# Cpp-course
Online component of the programming course I teach, including notes, exercises, projects, etc.

So far, the setup, basic C++, and SDL2 sections are complete, and the others are in progress.
The frequency of updates may fall considerably after May 2017, as I will be leading a different style of course next year.
